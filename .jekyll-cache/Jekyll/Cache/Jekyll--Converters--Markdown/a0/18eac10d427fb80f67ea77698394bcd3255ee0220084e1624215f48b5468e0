I"–<p>Is food your passion? Then the Culinary Arts program is perfect for you! Our day is spent preparing food for our customers who purchase sweet and savory goods through our student run operations, in order to prepare our student chefs for the food service industry.</p>

<p>In our hard-working and fast paced environment, students become skilled in food preparation, cooking and baking techniques by working in our full-sized, fully functioning kitchen. Students also gain authentic food preparation and hospitality skills as they learn to operate both our cafe and our full-service, Skyline-Bistro, which are open to the public throughout the school year.</p>
