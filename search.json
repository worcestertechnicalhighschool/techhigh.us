The site contained static content about our technical areas and news on the construction of our new building.In 2007, we launched the Techhigh Portal, a Microsoft Sharepoint site. This site contained the same static content, but included collaboration features of Sharepoint. When the Programming and Web Development shop was developed in 2010, our students took over the maintenance for our websites.In 2014, We launched the new techhigh.us WordPress site. This site was built from scratch by Programming and Web Development students. All content and photos were generated by our student authors.In September of 2017-2018 school year, Anthony Le, Jeffery Neal, and Mariah Donahue began work on the new site you see today. Their combined effort took an entire school-year to accomplish. The final result was over 2000 lines of code, spanning 30 files.This Wordpress theme is built with the mobile-first Bootstrap CSS framework and customized to look and feel like a modern, professional website. The information hierarchy utilizes categories to present the most relevant information to our visitors.Latest VersionIn 2022 we created a collaborative partnership between students in Programming and Web Development and Finance and Marketing. Through this partnership we rebuild techhigh.us with all new content, code, and workflow processes. This site is now build using Jekyll and is hosted on GitHub Pages. Students meet on Monday for our weekly production meeting. Features and content are discussed and assigned to students. Thursday is our regular build day where we push new versions of our code. Check back often to see our changes!"

This is a great opportunity to meet your new teachers and classmates, navigate the building, and learn about our 23 technical areas.“What is exploratory?”Leading up to choosing a trade area, Freshmen students will have the opportunity to experience eight different trade areas throughout a sixteen week period.“What are A Week and Z Week?”This is our alternating academic and technical area schedule! If a student started the school year in shop week, they are in the “Z week” group. If a student started the school year in academic week, they are in the “A week” group. For Z week students, their academic weeks fall on Z week and their shop weeks fall on A week. For A week students, their academic weeks fall on A week and their shop weeks fall on Z week. It can be confusing at first, but as the year goes on you’ll get the hang of it!“What is related theory?”This is the classroom portion of our trade areas that are taken everyday during a students’ academic week. Students will learn key concepts to help them master their trades further and will provide students with a much deeper and well balanced understanding of their trade areas.“When do freshmen get their shops?”Students will receive their trade areas once the 16 week exploratory program is over and administration has finished sorting all the students into the shops based on the students’ final trade areas rankings. This is usually around the months of January and February."
