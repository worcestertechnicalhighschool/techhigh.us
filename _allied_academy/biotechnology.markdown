Explore the sciences of life in our Biotechnology program. Immersed in industry techniques, taught by leading instructors in our state-of-the-art laboratories, students will learn how biological systems operate and how to develop innovative technologies and solutions to improve our lives.

Biotech is a rigorous program that requires students to have a strong interest in science and math. With our ever-advancing STEM field, our students are equipped with the knowledge and the current skills needed to approach problems with creativity and flexibility. Career opportunities are explored and evaluated through class discussions, laboratory experiments, research projects, guest speakers, and workplace visits. In addition, students develop the laboratory, critical thinking, and communication skills necessary for success both in the industry and in college. Our students also have the opportunity to take what they’ve learned inside the lab, and apply those skills nationally against other student leaders through SkillsUSA.
