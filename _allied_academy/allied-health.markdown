Immerse yourself in a caring and innovative environment in our Allied Health Program. With our robust simulation-based instruction, including experience in working with mannequins, students are equipped with the theory and the skill competencies to be successful and to make an impact in the healthcare field. 

Allied Health students are exposed to a wide range of real-world clinical work and have the opportunity to obtain internship experience and numerous certifications by their Senior year. Our students also have the opportunity to take what they’ve learned inside the classroom, and apply those skills nationally against other student leaders through SkillsUSA.
